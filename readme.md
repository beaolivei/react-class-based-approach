# Class React Components

Today we will discuss how to build react components using the class-based approach. 
Generically speaking, the react community has moved away from this approach, however, you may come across it when working on a legacy project.

## Today's agenda:

[] ES6 Classes
[] Functional Components (counter and movie search)
[] Class-Based Components (counter and movie search)
[] Props
[] State
[] Events
[] Lifecycle Methods
